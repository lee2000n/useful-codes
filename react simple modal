Frequently Asked Questions</span></strong></p>
<br />
<strong>1. What is mywellness?</strong><br />
Mywellness is a
central resource providing students access to mental health and wellness
information and supports.&nbsp;The information and tools available through mywellness
have been developed to assist students in increasing and/or sustaining optimal
health, so they can maintain a productive and positive lifestyle while
completing their studies.<br />
<strong><br />
<br />
2. How does it help Mental Illness?</strong><br />
Mywellness focuses on: Awareness (with on
campus information events), Education (with online toolbox, assessment and
Personalized Action Plan&rsquo;s), and Care (with online counselling and referrals to
resources on-campus and in the community).
<p id="spaces"><strong><span>Online Counselling
Module:</span></strong>&nbsp; One of our biggest
developments has been the online video counselling add-on. After supporting
students through awareness and assessment, navigating them to the appropriate
care that is right for them, is the next step. Students can assess mental
health professionals through secure and confidential online video counselling,
with the highest level of security and encryption available today. This option
is affordable and extremely easy to use. Students will be matched with
counsellors most suited to their needs. Their mental health assessment can
seamlessly link to their counselling notes as well, to enhance the match and
care. Our path leads students from awareness to care.</p>
<strong><br />
3. Can anyone see the results of my assessment?</strong><br />
No. Not only is your mywellness
account completely anonymous and confidential, but only you will have access to
your assessment results (Personal Action Plan). It is up to you if you wish to
share this information with anyone.<br />
<br />
<strong><br />
4. How accurate is the assessment?</strong><br />
Developed by
leading Mental Health Professionals, the Assessment is based
on the latest Diagnostics and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th
Edition and gold-standards of evidence-based practice in mental health. The
Personalized Action Plan that comes with the Assessment is developed based on
the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatment (CANMAT) Guidelines. The
Assessment systematically asks questions to determine an area of risk as well
as the level of risk related to the responses provided by the user.&nbsp; The Assessment does not aim to diagnose and
does not replace the diagnosis of a professional mental health care provider.<br />
<br />
<strong><br />
5. Can I only take the assessment once?</strong><br />
You can take the assessment as
many times as you want. In fact, it is encouraged that you take the assessment
multiple times a year to see your progress or any changes to your results.<br />
<br />
<strong><br />
6. Who can I talk to about my assessment results?</strong><br />
We recommend reaching out to a campus counselor or any of the community resources listed under Support
Resources.</div>
